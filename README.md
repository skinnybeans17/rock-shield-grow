# Rock Shield Grow
I bet you are all familiar with the game rock paper scissors. However, have you ever considered that while it's mainly a simple game, it can be turned into some thing much more than that? Well, here we are now! In this site, you get to play either by yourself, with a buddy, or even two close friends in three different variations of what was once simple, now more creative than ever!

## Game Modes
There are three different game modes to choose from here. They all function similarly in game style, but the idea of the inanimate objects used makes it much more!

### Classic
The classic game with the cutting tool, writing sheet, and solid formation. This is pretty self-explantory.
* Rock breaks Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock

### Nature
This is something that should be noticed if you're an expert with science. Three very common nature elements can do things with each. The burning, the liquid, and the plant.
* Fire burns Grass
* Grass absorbs Water
* Water extinguishes Fire

### Fantasy
If you're someone who's a fan of roleplaying games, you should know how this is like. Hit, block, or cast!
* Swords hits Spell
* Spell curses Shield
* Shield blocks Sword
